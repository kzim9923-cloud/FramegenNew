// Guards ncnn::Net load()/unload() (which internally call
// register_custom_layer + create_pipeline/destroy_pipeline — i.e. SPIR-V
// compilation and VkPipeline creation/teardown) across EVERY
// NcnnInterpolator/IfrnetInterpolator instance in the process, not just
// within one instance.
//
// There are two independent instances that can be alive at once, both
// bound to the same Vulkan device (vulkanDeviceIndex -1 -> device 0 in
// both call sites): the settings-screen "test this model" instance
// (g_ncnnInterpolator/g_ifrnetInterpolator in lsfg_jni.cpp) and the live
// session's instance (g.ai/g.aiIfrnet in lsfg_render_loop.cpp). Nothing
// previously stopped a settings-screen load() — compiling a new custom
// layer pipeline via create_pipeline() — from running concurrently with
// the live session's g.ai submitting per-frame Vulkan compute work on
// that same shared ncnn::VulkanDevice. That race is a credible cause of
// the SIGBUS crashes seen with fault addresses like 0x0000000100000001
// (a garbage/misaligned pointer, not a real heap address) landing inside
// this .so shortly after a load() completed successfully — i.e. driver-
// level corruption from the concurrent access, not a bug in the load()
// call that happened to be running.
//
// interpolate() itself is NOT guarded by this: concurrent inference from
// two Net instances sharing one VulkanDevice is the normal, supported
// ncnn usage pattern. Only load()/unload() (pipeline creation/teardown)
// need to be serialized against each other, process-wide.
//
// Recursive because load() unconditionally calls unload() first (reload
// path) and both take this same lock — a plain std::mutex would
// self-deadlock on that first line of load().

// Runs a single-network RIFE (IFNet, e.g. rife-v4.25-lite) ncnn graph
// against a pair of RGBA8 frames, producing the frame(s) between them.
//
// This replaces the previous two-stage FlowNetLite + RefineNetLite pipeline.
// A RIFE v4.x-style net takes the two source frames plus a per-pixel
// timestep map and predicts the frame at that timestep directly in one
// forward pass — no separate refine network, and (unlike the old
// architecture) arbitrary timesteps are natively supported, so
// interpolate() computes each output frame's timestep directly
// (k / multiplier) instead of recursing through fixed t=0.5 midpoints.
//
// Model shape contract (verified against a rife-v4.25-lite_ensembleFalse
// flownet.param exported the standard rife-ncnn-vulkan way):
//   in0  = frame A, RGB, normalized to [0,1], padded up to a multiple of 32
//   in1  = frame C, same shape as in0
//   in2  = timestep map: 1-channel, same H/W as the padded frames, every
//          pixel filled with the requested timestep in [0,1]
//   out0 = predicted frame at that timestep, RGB [0,1], same padded shape
//
// The .param also references a "rife.Warp" layer type that isn't part of
// stock ncnn — RifeWarp.cpp/.hpp implement and register it as a Vulkan compute layer before load_param() is called.
//
// CPU-only policy: load() creates an ncnn::Net with Vulkan compute disabled.
// If CPU model loading fails, the caller can preserve the real frame rather than
// silently switching this backend back to GPU compute.
