/**
 * Required declaration so the user can enable the "LSFG Touch Passthrough" service
 * from Settings → Accessibility. The service has two independent jobs:
 *
 *  1. Drives the Automatic Overlay feature by forwarding TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED
 *     events to [AutoOverlayController].
 *  2. Hosts the overlay window as TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY when the user enables
 *     "trusted overlay" mode (see [OverlayManager.show]), which is the primary fix
 *     for touch pass-through on strict AOSP builds.
 *
 * Gesture forwarding (this file's [forwardTap] / [forwardSwipe]) is a *secondary*,
 * opt-in fallback for the small set of devices where even the trusted-overlay path
 * still drops or mis-routes a touch — instead of relying on the overlay window's
 * touchable-region being honoured, the accessibility service synthesizes the same
 * gesture directly at the coordinates the game should have received it at. It is
 * off by default (see [com.firstt175.deepdrop.prefs.LsfgConfig.gestureForwardingEnabled])
 * because [AccessibilityService.dispatchGesture] targets whatever window currently
 * has focus, which is indistinguishable from "the game" only when the overlay
 * itself is confirmed non-interactive — enabling this on a device where normal
 * pass-through already works would inject a duplicate touch on top of the one the
 * system already delivered.
 *
 * No caller wires this in yet. It is exposed as a small, self-contained API on the
 * service so a future touch-fallback path (e.g. a watchdog in [OverlayManager] that
 * detects pass-through failures) can call it without needing to know about
 * AccessibilityService internals.
