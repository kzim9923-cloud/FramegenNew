/**
 * Lightweight, non-blocking build-signature check.
 *
 * This is *not* DRM and it never disables the app: the project is GPL v3.0,
 * so anyone is free to fork, modify, and run their own build. What this
 * exists for is purely informational — helping a user who downloaded an APK
 * from an untrusted third party (a reseller, a shady "modded" mirror, a
 * random Telegram channel) notice that what's running on their phone isn't
 * the build the developer actually published, before they trust it with
 * root/Shizuku access or a MediaProjection grant.
 *
 * How it works: at release-signing time the maintainer fills in
 * [OFFICIAL_SIGNATURE_SHA256] with the SHA-256 hash of their release signing
 * certificate (see the comment below for how to compute it). At runtime we
 * hash whatever certificate the currently-running APK was actually signed
 * with and compare. If the maintainer never filled the constant in, the
 * check is skipped entirely — it fails open, never closed, and no UI is
 * shown either way.
