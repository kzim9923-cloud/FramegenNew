/**
 * Logging wrapper that mirrors calls to both logcat and the shared
 * `filesDir/diagnostics/lsfg.log` file used by the crash reporter. Use
 * instead of android.util.Log for any message that should survive a remote
 * test session.
 *
 * Each line records timestamp, level, thread name, and tag — the thread
 * name plus tag together identify exactly which subsystem produced the
 * line (capture, fps, service, etc. each run on their own HandlerThread),
 * which is what actually lets a crash be traced back to the part of the
 * app that broke.
 *
 * Logging can be turned off entirely via [setEnabled] (persisted, off
 * reduces background work — the file write + logcat call on every line is
 * the main cost, not the file itself). Errors ([e]) are always written
 * regardless of the toggle, since they're low-volume and are what crash
 * diagnosis actually depends on.
 *
 * Initialised lazily from [init] (called by LsfgApplication). If init was
 * never reached, we silently fall through to logcat-only.
